# Bubble Sort Midterm Project

Link to the deployed version on GitHub Pages:

This project is a visual presentation of the bubble sort algorithm.

The program sorts a series of numbers, which are displayed as colorful boxes on the screen.

Each part of the sorting process is animated, so the user can follow how the algorithm compares and swaps elements until the list is fully sorted.

Pay close attention to see the numbers change.

We hope you enjoy our application.
